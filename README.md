Basic code in Python for NLP Course.


This simple code show how we can implement a parse tree for a switch statement of this type :

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 x = 1;
   y = 2;

- the switch instruction has the following syntax

   switch(var) {
     case 0: z=cost0;
             break;

     â€¦..
     case N: z=costN;
             break;

     default: z=costD;
             break;
   }

- the instruction contains only the assignment
   of a constant value to the variable z

- at the end print the value of the variable z

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can find :

1) a swithc.lark file in which is described the grammar used to solve the problem.

2) a switch.py file in which i try to solve the program.

3) a pdf file in which there is the parse tree.
